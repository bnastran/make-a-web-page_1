      <b>Web </b>
      is interaction of multiple elements.
      People using <b>computers</b>, connected to <b>internet</b>. 
      When visiting web page computer sends <b>HTTP</b> request to the server, 
      server returns requested HTML document to user's computer, 
      which is displayed on user's' <em>web browser</em>.

      <b>HTML</b> is abbreviation for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. HTML documents are <b>hearth</b> of the web.
      it consist from <b>text content</b> is <u>what you see</u>, and <b>markup</b>, <u>what it looks like</u>. 
      Also can have <u>references</u> to other documents like images or video, and has links to other documents

    <div class="borut-note"> 
    <p> 
      <b>HTML markup</b> basic elements are <em>Tags</em>. It has following structure <em>opening tag</em> content <em> closing tag</em>
      Whole structure with opening tag, content and closing tag is <b>ELEMENT</b>.
     </p> 
     <p>There are numerous of different tags. Code writer should   be accurate, as computers don't forgive mistakes.
      Some programmers say that computers are stupid.

      HTML element can have new elements inside of element, we are talking that it is <em>tree like structure</em>.
      Like in a tree, big branch has smaller branches and small branch has even smaller.

    <div class="borut-note"> 
    <p>
      Webpage is made of many boxes. Big box can be cut to smaller boxes. Boxes can me moved on page.
      Code writers use <em>class attributes</em> to <em>label</em> boxes.
      Writing HTLM code we use <b>tag DIV</b> to define a box.

      <h3>CSS</h3>
      </div>
    <div class="borut-note"> 
    <p> 
    CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements. CSS stands for <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
    "Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements.

      <h3>Adding CSS in web page</h3>
      </div>
    <div class="borut-note"> 
    <p> 
   There are three metods we can use:
    </p>  
    <p>
      Method 1: write CSS in the <em>head</em> of your HTML - This method is good for very small projects
      </p>
      <p>
        Method 2: Link your HTML to a <em>separate CSS file</em> - it lets you stay more organized when working on larger projects
      </p>
      <p>
        Method 3: Write your style <em>inline</em> with your HTML - This is generally a very bad idea because it leads to lots of repeated code. When we decide to do small style change on site, and if change is on multipole location we have to make changes everywhere and there is increased risk to hit the problems.

      <h3>Avoiding Repetition</h3>
      </div>
    <div class="borut-note"> 
    <p> 
    Avoiding repetition is important principle of programming. Repetitions in programming could lead to two problems: errors and no consistency. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The programmer has to do same procedure over and over and if they don’t avoid repetition and in that  case the risk of error increase. In his work programmer has to copy and past style attributes to many HTML elements. In case programmer decides to chance some attribute, it can lead to errors when they don't avoid repetition. If he doesn't avoid repetition, he is forced to do same changes everywhere the repeated code appears. Whole code can be very long and there is high probability that there will occur errors and mistakes. So avoiding repetition means also <b>avoiding errors</b>. 
    </p>
    <p>
     Avoiding repetition also means <b>consistency</b>. Programmer could assign for each »box« a div class and specify the style for specific class in CSS. Now the programmer has chance to change style of selected divs very simple, fast and without risk of error. All boxes with same div class will look exactly the same. They have same style which is specified in CSS.  
     </p>

      <h3>Box Sizing and Positioning</h3>
      </div>
    <div class="borut-note"> 
      <h4> SIZE</h4>
      <p> 
    Each box has 4 components. 	Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right. Another issue is that each browser word differentely and can display code differnt.   
    </p>
    <p>
    There are 2 techniques we can use: 
      <br>Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.
      <br>Set the <span class="code">box-sizing</span> attribute to <span class="code">border-box</span> for every element.
    </p>
    <h4> POSITION</h4>
    <p> 
    Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Adding the rule <span class="code">display: flex;</span>to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.
